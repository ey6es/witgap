Things to do, in no particular order:

Invite system:
- Invite codes with counts, flags (insider, etc.)
- Text field in invite (e-mail address for personal invites)
- See how many accounts created
- Create: generic with N, list of e-mails

Script:
- Lists rather than (in addition to) vectors
- Records
- Record serialization

Multi-line text editing

General mail system:
- Friend invites, guild invites, standard messages, etc.
- Item/currency attachments

Items:
- With counts
- Generalized data using serialization

Currency:
- Hard versus soft?
- Start with soft: credits

Player stats:
- HP?
- Level?
- Skills?

Friends:
- Invitations with text
- Notify when logged on/off
- List, allow removal
- Limit number (150?)

Clubs:
- Allow membership in more than one
- Dues
- Ranks

Proper instance/scene maintenance (remove after N minutes of disuse)

Scene persistence
- Manual save?
- Mark instance as definitive, save definitive instances on exit?
- Broadcast changes to all instances?

Anonymous users should be users, not just sessions
