Witgap Style Guide
------------------

Prime directive: make it look like the code around it.

Preamble/ifdef blocks

Forward references

Classes per file

Const-correctness, rule of three, RAII

Follow Qt naming conventions for getters/setters; setters before getters.

Brace style like Three Rings.

Parentheses for definition vs. invocation.

Prefer protected to private.

Member ordering.

Prefix protected/private members with underscore.

Camel-case.

"virtual," defaults for subclasses

object ownership

doxygen documentation

avoid "abstraction paralysis"; remember, can always refactor

prioritize readability/maintainability over performance in non-critical areas

double up loop variables (ii, jj, kk)

avoid abbreviation in public members

line breaks for method calls/definitions

whitespace between blocks

100 columns

casting: should prefer static_cast/qobject_cast rather than c-style

prefer early breaks over deep nesting

prefer pointers over references for in-out parameters

indents are always four spaces; no tab characters

when possible, use forward declarations rather than includes

use 0 rather than NULL

for forward declarations and includes: standard libraries, external libraries, internals
(alphabetic order)

don't repeat yourself: a couple repetitions is OK, but once you repeat something three or more
times, or if it's a lengthy block, break it out into a function/class

break overlong functions/overlarge classes into multiple functions/contained classes

YAGNI

Use local variables rather than repeating the same getter(s)
