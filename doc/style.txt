Witgap Style Guide
------------------

Prime directive: make it look like the code around it.

Preamble/ifdef blocks

Forward references

Classes per file

Const-correctness, rule of three, RAII

Follow Qt naming conventions for getters/setters.

Brace style like Three Rings.

Parentheses for definition vs. invocation.

Prefer protected to private.

Member ordering.

Prefix protected/private members with underscore.

Camel-case.

"virtual," defaults for subclasses

object ownership

doxygen documentation

avoid "abstraction paralysis"; remember, can always refactor

prioritize readability/maintainability over performance in non-critical areas

double up loop variables (ii, jj, kk)

avoid abbreviation in public members

line breaks for method calls/definitions

whitespace between blocks
